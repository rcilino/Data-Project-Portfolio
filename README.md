* [2024 NEAIR Conference Presentation - Methodologies for Determining Student Performance Risk]() - Currently a work-in-process while preparing this presentation accepted to be presented at the 2024 NEAIR Conference. We demonstrate a few methodologies that people at different skill levels can utilize to determine specific student characteristics at their institution that indicate a student's risk of succeeding at that institution. We also demonstrate how we used those determined characteristics to identify students to target for intervention methods, categorizing a "risk factor" and assigning different interventions based on those higher or lower "risk factors".<br><br>
