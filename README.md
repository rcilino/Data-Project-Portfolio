# Robert Cilino's Data Project Portfolio

* [2024 NEAIR Conference Presentation - Methodologies for Determining Student Performance Risk]() - Currently a work-in-process while preparing this presentation accepted to be presented at the 2024 NEAIR Conference. We demonstrate a few methodologies that people at different skill levels can utilize to determine specific student characteristics at their institution that indicate a student's risk of succeeding at that institution. We also demonstrate how we used those determined characteristics to identify students to target for intervention methods, categorizing a "risk factor" and assigning different interventions based on those higher or lower "risk factors".

*Skills demonstrated: SQL, Excel, Python, Correlation, Data Cleaning*

* [Local Winter Weather Pattern Analysis](https://rawcdn.githack.com/rcilino/Data-Project-Portfolio/5434143dfb322c66b39ba0b873cc4a2c04aa9073/Local%20Winter%20Weather%20Analysis.html) - Using Python I visualize local weather data from NOAA to investigate my observations and hypothesis that winters in my area are becoming shorter, warmer, and less snowy.

*Skills demonstrated: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Data Cleaning*

* [Undergraduate Honors Thesis in Econometrics]() - Title: "Quantitative Effects of Institution Characteristics on Institution Success" - Is there any particular characteristic of higher education institutions that drives their success? I used a 2SLS regression to find an answer using IPEDS data from thousands of schools across the United States.
